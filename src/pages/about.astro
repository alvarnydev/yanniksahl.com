          <p class="">
            I like to create things that are both functional and easy to use. On
            the web that means focussing on both form and function, never
            forgetting the user in the creation process. When it comes to
            architecture I like to think about the big picture and how all the
            pieces fit together. I enjoy the challenge of finding the right
            solution for a given problem and the satisfaction of seeing it come
            to life.

            Every day I strive to become a little bit better at what I do. I
            believe that learning is a lifelong journey and I am always looking
            for new opportunities to grow and improve. I am passionate about
            technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems.
